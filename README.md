## Machine-Learning
### In this ML Classification project, I try to utilise Machine Learning to help banks to reduce default risk which utilise past dataset to make future predictions as accurate as possible.
### Since lending is one of the most important activities in the financial industry such as banking and finance (Retail banking, Commerical banking or Corporate banking...etc)
### the project is based on a loan dataset from "LendingClub bank" which is considered as a large dataset (60.6 MB) from the year of 2017 to 2018 that contains over 100k observations each with 150+ variables
### things we are trying to predict: 1. Creditworthiness of the borrower 2. How likely will he or she default our loan
